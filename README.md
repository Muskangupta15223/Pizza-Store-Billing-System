🚀 Excited to share my latest project! 🍕

I'm thrilled to announce the launch of my Pizza Store Billing System, a Java-based solution designed to make pizza orders seamless and efficient.

Here’s what it’s all about:
👉 Two Pizza Options: Regular and Deluxe pizzas to satisfy every craving!
👉 Automated Billing: Accurate and detailed bills for each order.
👉 Java Power: Built entirely using Java, showcasing the power of object-oriented programming.

This project reflects my passion for blending technology with real-world applications, and I'm proud of how it came together. Whether you're a developer, a pizza lover, or both, I'd love to hear your thoughts!

Looking forward to connecting with fellow tech enthusiasts and sharing more about this journey.
